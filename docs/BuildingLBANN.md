# Building LBANN
## Download

LBANN can be cloned from the [Github repo](https://github.com/LLNL/lbann).

## Dependencies

The following third-party packages are currently required to build
LBANN. All may be installed using
[spack](https://github.com/llnl/spack).

+ A C++11-compliant compiler.
+ OpenMP, version 3.0 or newer.
+ An MPI-3.0 implementation.
+ [CMake](https://cmake.org), version 3.9 or newer.
+ [CNPY](https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy.git) is used to ingest data
  in NumPy format. In principle this should be optional, but at time
  of writing, LBANN will not build without it.
+ [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) is used to preprocess
  image data. For performance reasons, it is recommend to build OpenCV
  with [JPEG-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo)
  for JPEG format support.
+ [ProtoBuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) is used to
  express models in a portable format.

The following third-party packages are optional.

+ [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). The development
  team currently uses CUDA version 9.2. Building with CUDA support
  requires that Hydrogen has been built with CUDA support (see below).
  + [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) is required if
    building LBANN with CUDA support. It is freely available as a binary
    distribution from NVIDIA.
+ [HWLOC](https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/). HWLOC enables
  LBANN to make certain optimizations based on the hardware
  topology. Its use is strongly recommended.
+ NVTX. LBANN supports some improved annotations for NVPROF using
  NVTX. NVTX is provided as part of the CUDA toolkit.
+ VTune. LBANN supports some improved annotations for VTune.

The following LLNL-maintained packages are required.

+ [Hydrogen](https://github.com/llnl/elemental) is a fork of the
  Elemental distributed dense linear-algebra library and it may be
  installed via [spack](https://github.com/llnl/spack) using the
  package name "hydrogen". If CUDA support is enabled in Hydrogen,
  LBANN will inherit this support.

The following LLNL-maintained packages are optional.

+ [Aluminum](https://github.com/llnl/aluminum) is a
  communication library optimized for machine learning and interaction
  with GPUs. We cannot recommend its use strongly enough. It can be
  built using [spack](https://github.com/llnl/spack).
+ [CONDUIT](https://github.com/llnl/conduit) is used to ingest
  structured data produced by scientific simulations.


## Building with [Spack](https://github.com/llnl/spack)

### Setup Spack and local base tools

1.  Download and install [Spack](https://github.com/llnl/spack).
    Additionally setup shell support as discussed
    [here](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_file_support.html#id2).

    ``` 
    . ${SPACK_ROOT}/share/spack/setup-env.sh
    ```

2.  Setup your compiler and external software environment. For example,
    on LLNL\'s LC machines, one might load the following modules:
    ```
    ml gcc/7.3.0 mvapich2/2.3 cuda/10.0.130 # Pascal
    ```
    or
    ```
    ml gcc/7.3.1 cuda/9.2.148 spectrum-mpi/rolling-release  # Lassen / Sierra
    ```

    + Note to remove unwanted modules you can execute: `ml purge`

### Building & Installing LBANN as a user

### Building & Installing LBANN as a developer

1.  Establish a spack environment and install software dependencies.
    Note that there are four environments to pick from along two axis:

    1. developers or users
    2. x86_64 and ppc64le

    For example if you are a developer and want to build the inside of
    the git repo use the following instructions:[^libarypath]

    ```
    export LBANN_HOME=<path to lbann git repo>
    export LBANN_BUILD_DIR=<path to a directory>
    export LBANN_INSTALL_DIR=<path to a directory>
    cd ${LBANN_BUILD_DIR}
    spack env create -d . ${LBANN_HOME}/spack_environments/developer_release_<arch>_cuda_spack.yaml # where <arch> = x86_64 | ppc64le
    spack install
    spack env loads # Spack creates a file named loads that has all of the correct modules
    source loads
    unset LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

    + Note that the environments provided here have a set of external
      packages and compilers that are installed on an LLNL LC CZ sytem.
      Please update these for your system environment.  Alternatively,
      you can create baseline versions of the user-level spack configuation
      files and remove the externals and compilers from the spack.yaml
      file. See [here](spack_environment.md) for details.

    + Note that the initial build of all of the standard packages in spack
      will take a while.

    + Note that the spack module files set the LIBRARY_PATH environment
      variable. This behavior allows autotools based builds to pickup the
      correct libraries, but interferes with the way that CMake sets up
      RPATHs.  To correctly establish the RPATH please unset the variable
      as noted above, or you can explicity pass the RPATH fields to CMake
      using a command such as: `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=$(sed 's/:/;/g' <<< "${LIBRARY_PATH}") -DCMAKE_BUILD_RPATH=$(sed 's/:/;/g' <<< "${LIBRARY_PATH}") ...`

2.  Build LBANN locally from source and build Hydrogen and Aluminum
    using the superbuild.  See below for a list and descriptions of all
    CMake flags known to LBANN's build system. An example build that
    expects LBANN_HOME, LBANN_BUILD_DIR, LBANN_INSTALL_DIR environment
    variables might be:
    ```
    cmake \
      -G Ninja \
      -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_ALUMINUM=ON \
      -D ALUMINUM_ENABLE_MPI_CUDA=OFF \
      -D ALUMINUM_ENABLE_NCCL=ON \
      -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_HYDROGEN=ON \
      -D Hydrogen_ENABLE_CUDA=ON \
      -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_LBANN=ON \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
      -D LBANN_WITH_CUDA:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_NVPROF:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_DATATYPE:STRING=float \
      -D LBANN_WITH_TOPO_AWARE:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_ALUMINUM:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_CONDUIT:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_CUDA:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_CUDNN:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_NCCL:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_SOFTMAX_CUDA:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_SEQUENTIAL_INITIALIZATION:BOOL=OFF \
      -D LBANN_WITH_TBINF=OFF \
      -D LBANN_WITH_VTUNE:BOOL=OFF \
      -D LBANN_DATATYPE=float \
      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${LBANN_INSTALL_DIR} \
      ${LBANN_HOME}/superbuild

    ninja
    ```

## Building with [CMake](https://cmake.org)

LBANN uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) for its build system and a
version newer than or equal to 3.9.0 is required. LBANN development is
done primarily on UNIX-based platforms. As such, the build is tested
regularly on Linux-based machines, occasionally on OSX, and never on
Windows machines.

It is required that LBANN be built out-of-source. That is, CMake must
not be invoked in a directory containing a CMakeLists.

### LBANN CMake options
The following options are exposed in the CMake build system.

+ `LBANN_WITH_ALUMINUM` (Default: `OFF`): Use the Aluminum communication
  package. This will be set to `ON` automatically if Hydrogen was
  built with Aluminum.

+ `LBANN_WITH_CNPY` (Default: `ON`): Build with support for CNPY for reading
  Numpy data.

+ `LBANN_WITH_CONDUIT` (Default: `OFF`): Build with support for CONDUIT.

+ `LBANN_WITH_NVPROF` (Default: `OFF`): Build with extra annotations for NVPROF.

+ `LBANN_WITH_TOPO_AWARE` (Default: `ON`): Use HWLOC for topology-aware choices.

+ `LBANN_WITH_TBINF` (Default: `ON`): Enable the Tensorboard interace.

+ `LBANN_WITH_VTUNE` (Default: `OFF`): Build with extra annotations for VTune.

+ `LBANN_DETERMINISTIC` (Default: `OFF`): Force as much of the code as possible
  to be deterministic. This is not a guarantee as certain operations
  in third-party libraries cannot be forced into a deterministic mode,
  especially for CUDA-enabled builds.

+ `LBANN_SEQUENTIAL_INITIALIZATION` (Default: `OFF`): Force sequentially
  consistent initialization of data structures.

+ `LBANN_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` (Default: `OFF`): Promote compiler
  warnings to errors. This should be used by developers
  only. Developers are encouraged to build with this `ON` prior to
  merging any code into the repository.

+ `LBANN_USE_PROTOBUF_MODULE` (Default: `OFF`): Search for Protobuf
  using CMake's `FindProtobuf.cmake` module instead of the Protobuf
  config file. This is useful on platforms with differently
  architected compute nodes or when the config method is inexplicably
  failing.

The following variables may also be set:

+ `LBANN_DATATYPE` (Default: `float`): The datatype to use for
  training. Currently this must be `float` or `double`.

The following variable has been deprecated and removed:

+ `LBANN_WITH_CUDA`. The "CUDA-ness" of LBANN is now tied 1:1 with the
  "CUDA-ness" of Hydrogen. At present, it seems like unnecessary
  overhead to support the situation in which Hydrogen has CUDA support
  but LBANN doesn't want to use it until a compelling use-case reveals
  itself.

### Controlling dependency resolution
The following variables may be set with CMake to identify dependencies
that are not installed into the "typical" locations that CMake
searches by default. They may be either exported into the environment
used by CMake using whatever mechanisms are allowed by the shell or
passed to CMake as a cache variable
(e.g., `cmake -DPKG_DIR=/path/to/pkg`).
The latter option is recommended.

+ `Aluminum_DIR` or `ALUMINUM_DIR` or `AL_DIR`: The path to _either_
  the Aluminum installation prefix _or_ the AluminumConfig.cmake
  file. If Hydrogen has not been built with Aluminum support, set
  `LBANN_WITH_ALUMINUM=ON` to enable Aluminum support.
+ `CNPY_DIR`: The path to the CNPY installation prefix. Must set
  `LBANN_WITH_CNPY=ON` to enable CNPY support.
+ `CONDUIT_DIR` or `CONDUIT_DIR`: The path to _either_ the
  CONDUIT installation prefix _or_ the conduit.cmake file. Must set
  `LBANN_WITH_CONDUIT=ON` to enable CONDUIT support.
  + `HDF5_DIR`: The path to _either_ the HDF5 installation prefix _or_
    the hdf5_config.cmake file. There is a known issue with CONDUIT
    that it may link to HDF5 but not properly export that dependency.
+ `HWLOC_DIR`: The path to the HWLOC installation prefix. Must set
  `LBANN_WITH_HWLOC=ON` to enable HWLOC support.
+ `Hydrogen_DIR` or `HYDROGEN_DIR`: The path to _either_ the Hydrogen
  installation prefix _or_ the HydrogenConfig.cmake file.
+ `NVTX_DIR`: The path the the prefix of NVTX. This should not be used
  except in circumstances in which one might want to link to a
  different NVTX installation than the CUDA toolkit. Under normal
  circumstances, if CUDA was found without issue, NVTX should be as
  well.
+ `OpenCV_DIR` or `OPENCV_DIR`: The path to _either_ the OpenCV
  installation prefix _or_ the OpenCVConfig.cmake file.
+ `Protobuf_DIR` or `PROTOBUF_DIR`: The path to _either_ the Protobuf
  installation prefix _or_ the protobuf-config.cmake file.
+ `VTUNE_DIR`: The path to the prefix of the VTune (or Intel compiler
  suite) installation.

Compilers, include CUDA compilers, are found using the default CMake
mechanisms, as are OpenMP and MPI. Thus, the process of finding these
tools can be manipulated using the usual CMake mechanisms and/or cache
variables as [documented by CMake](https://cmake.org/documentation).

Except where otherwise noted, this list attempts to address the first
level of dependencies of LBANN, that is, those that are one edge away
in the DAG. If deeper dependency issues appear, please consult the
documentation of the packages that are causing the issues as they may
require additional CMake/environment flags to be set before properly
resolving.

### Example CMake invocation
A sample CMake build for LBANN might look like the following.

    cmake \
      -D LBANN_WITH_CUDA:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_WITH_NVPROF:BOOL=ON \
      -D LBANN_DATATYPE:STRING=float \
      -D Hydrogen_DIR:PATH=/path/to/hydrogen \
      -D HWLOC_DIR:PATH=/path/to/hwloc \
      /path/to/lbann

## Building an entire ecosystem with the "Superbuild"

__WARNING__: This is primarily for developer convenience and is not
meant to be robust to all possible use-cases for LBANN.

LBANN includes CMake `ExternalProject` definitions for a large portion
of its dependency graph. The following dependencies are
supported. These are one or two edges from LBANN in the
dependency DAG.

+ Aluminum
+ CNPY
+ CONDUIT
+ [CUB](https://github.com/nvlabs/cub). This is used by Hydrogen for
  efficiently managing GPU memory.
+ [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5). This is a
  dependency of CONDUIT.
+ Hydrogen
+ [JPEG-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo). This
  is a dependency of OpenCV.
+ [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git). This is an
  optional dependency of Hydrogen. It is recommended if your system
  does not have a system-optimized BLAS distribution (e.g., Intel's MKL).
+ OpenCV
+ Protobuf

The following dependencies are known to exist but for some reason or
another are not supported by the superbuild framework.

+ cuDNN is a freely available binary package available from NVIDIA.
+ NCCL is a freely available binary package available from
  NVIDIA. Inspired users may also build it from source from its
  [github repository](https://github.com/nvidia/nccl).
+ HWLOC is often installed by default, especially on large
  supercomputers. Certain components may require superuser access to
  configure, but these features are not used by LBANN. If it is not
  available, ask the system administrators, consult the package
  manager, install using Spack, or build from
  [source](https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/).

The superbuild system is itself a CMake project rooted in
`$LBANN_HOME/superbuild` (distinct from the LBANN CMake project rooted
in `$LBANN_HOME`). Options that control the superbuild system are
prefixed with `LBANN_SB_`; other options that appear in a CMake
invocation for the superbuild are either interpreted on a sub-project
basis or forwarded to certain sub-projects.

### Choosing packages to build in the Superbuild
The superbuild system is _constructive_ or _additive_; that is, it
will only build the packages that it is asked to build. Any required
package that is not requested is assumed to exist on the system by the
time it is needed by whichever package requires it. For example, if
HDF5 is provided by the system administrators on a system, it does not
need to be built and CONDUIT can be built by pointing its build to the
system HDF5.

Packages are included in a superbuild by passing
`LBANN_SB_BUILD_<PKG>` options to CMake _for each package_ that it
should build, including LBANN itself. E.g.,

    cmake \
      -DLBANN_SB_BUILD_ALUMINUM=ON \
      -DLBANN_SB_BUILD_HYDROGEN=ON \
      -DLBANN_SB_BUILD_LBANN=ON \
      /path/to/lbann/superbuild

will invoke the superbuild to build Aluminum, Hydrogen, and LBANN
_only_. Acceptable values for `<PKG>` are `ALUMINUM`, `CNPY`,
`CONDUIT`, `CUB`, `HDF5`, `HYDROGEN`, `JPEG_TURBO`, `OPENCV`,
`PROTOBUF` and `LBANN`.

### Forwarding options to sub-projects
The subprojects are largely pre-configured to "do the right thing" for
building LBANN. However, there are some variables that users of the
superbuild system may need to control. These are exposed as regular
CMake options in the individual projects' CMakeLists and can be viewed
by running, e.g.,

    cmake -L superbuild/<pkg>/CMakeLists.txt

Several significant CMake flags are automatically forwarded from the
superbuild CMake to subprojects. These are generally "typical" CMake
flags (but not all; if something is missing, open please
[an issue](https://github.com/llnl/lbann/issues)). Some examples are

+ `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
+ `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`
+ `CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`
+ `CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`

To accommodate developers working on edge-cases with these
dependencies, any flag may be forwarded to any CMake-built package
using the following syntax:
`LBANN_SB_FWD_<PKG>_<OPTION>=<VALUE>`. This will result in a cache
variable being sent to the CMake command for `<PKG>` with the form

    -D<OPTION>=<VALUE>

The `<OPTION>` may be something specific to `<PKG>` or it may
be a CMake flag that is not automatically forwarded. For example, the
following CMake invocation would send
`CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` to the `HYDROGEN` package and
`SPHINX_DIR` to `LBANN`:

    cmake -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_HYDROGEN=ON \
      -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_LBANN=ON \
      -D LBANN_SB_FWD_HYDROGEN_CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION=ON \
      -D LBANN_SB_FWD_LBANN_SPHINX_DIR=/path/to/sphinx \
      /path/to/superbuild

### Special targets in the Superbuild
Modern shells should be able to tab-complete the names of targets in
Makefiles or Ninja files, and IDEs should display all targets
interactively. The superbuild should create project-level targets for
all of the subprojects; these match the `<PKG>` values noted
above. For example, after a successful CMake configuration of the
superbuild using the Ninja generator, the command

    ninja HYDROGEN

will build the sub-DAG ending with Hydrogen. If
`LBANN_SB_BUILD_LBANN=ON`, `ninja LBANN` is equivalent to `ninja`
since LBANN depends on all other targets built by the superbuild.

When building on UNIX platforms, the "Unix Makefiles" and "Ninja"
generators will have special targets defined for debugging superbuild
issues. These targets are `gather-build` and `gather-log`. These
create tarballs of the build system files and the execution logs
generated for the superbuild or during the superbuild build phase,
respectively. The target `gather-all` depends on both of these targets
and may be used to generate both tarballs at once. The resulting
tarballs are helpful to the build system maintainers for debugging
build issues if using the superbuild system.

### A full superbuild example
A full invocation to the superbuild that builds all dependencies might
look like the following. This example will use a CUDA-enabled build
with Aluminum and CONDUIT support using the currently-load GCC
toolset. It assumes that desired flags are stored in `<LANG>_FLAGS` in
the environment.

    cmake -GNinja \
        -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PWD}/install \
        -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which gcc) \
        -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS="${C_FLAGS}" \
        -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which g++) \
        -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="${CXX_FLAGS}" \
        -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=$(which gfortran) \
        -D CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="${Fortran_FLAGS}" \
        -D CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=$(which nvcc) \
        -D CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS="${CUDA_FLAGS}" \
        \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_CNPY=ON \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_CONDUIT=ON \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_CUB=ON \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_HDF5=ON \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_JPEG_TURBO=ON \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_OPENBLAS=ON \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_OPENCV=ON \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_PROTOBUF=ON \
        \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_ALUMINUM=ON \
        -D ALUMINUM_ENABLE_MPI_CUDA=ON \
        -D ALUMINUM_ENABLE_NCCL=ON \
        \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_HYDROGEN=ON \
        -D Hydrogen_ENABLE_CUDA=ON \
        -D Hydrogen_ENABLE_CUB=ON \
        -D Hydrogen_ENABLE_ALUMINUM=ON \
        \
        -D LBANN_SB_BUILD_LBANN=ON \
        -D LBANN_WITH_ALUMINUM=ON \
        -D LBANN_WITH_CONDUIT=ON \
        -D LBANN_WITH_CUDA=ON \
        -D LBANN_WITH_NVPROF=ON \
        -D LBANN_WITH_TBINF=ON \
        -D LBANN_WITH_TOPO_AWARE=ON \
        -D LBANN_SEQUENTIAL_INITIALIZATION=OFF \
        -D LBANN_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF \
        \
        /path/to/superbuild

As a final disclaimer: Please do report any issues with the superbuild
on [github](https://github.com/llnl/lbann/issues), but note that they
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may not be fixed in a
timely manner or at all if they do not affect the development team. To
repeat, the superbuild exists for developer convenience and is not
meant to supplant a legitimate package manager.

## Deprecated or special-use methods
At time of writing, there is another developer-only build method. The
`build_lbann_lc.sh` script in the `scripts/` directory exists for use
_by developers only_. Certain paths through this script require access
to a certain linux group on the Livermore Computing machines (LC) and
the script may not work for those without that access. Please consult
the preceding sections for alternative and preferred methods for
building LBANN.
