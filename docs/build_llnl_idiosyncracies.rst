Specific information for Livermore Computing (LC) systems
============================================================

.. warning:: Many features below make assumptions that users belong to
             certain groups on LC systems. Any information contained
             here should not be considered general-purpose and any
             examples are not expected to work except for certain
             users on LLNL's LC systems.

The :code:`build_lbann_lc.sh` script
----------------------------------------

The :code:`build_lbann_lc.sh` script in the :code:`scripts/` directory
is a historical script with logic to choose the "right" compilers
and grab all the LC-installed dependencies. It is updated on an
*ad-hoc* basis by the subset of developers who use it and it should
not be relied upon as a replacement for other methods described in
this guide.

.. warning:: Certain paths through this script require access to a
             certain linux group on the Livermore Computing
             machines (LC) at LLNL.


Pre-installed Binary Packages
------------------------------
.. comment:: need to update this section with newer versions or perhaps remove if this method is no longer used by developers
The LC machines have many instances of cuDNN and NCCL installed in
locations shared by the :code:`brain` group. These may be consistently
detected by CMake by :code:`export`-ing their locations into the
shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    export CUDNN_DIR=/usr/WS2/brain/cudnn/cudnn-7.4.2/cuda-10.0_x86_64
    export NCCL_DIR=/usr/WS2/brain/nccl2/nccl_2.4.2-1+cuda10.0_x86_64

Notice that this is specific to using CUDA 10.0 on an x86_64 LC
machine. This is a shortcut around formally passing this location as a
cache variable to all relevant CMake projects. The cache method for
passing these to the LBANN CMake is:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake CUDNN_DIR=/usr/WS2/brain/cudnn/cudnn-7.4.2/cuda-10.0_x86_64 \
        <other args> \
        /path/to/lbann

LBANN will detect NCCL automatically from the Aluminum import; there
should be no need to pass :code:`NCCL_DIR` to the LBANN CMake.

The Superbuild, on the other hand, may require both :code:`CUDNN_DIR`
and :code:`NCCL_DIR` if building both Aluminum and LBANN. Such an
invocation might be:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DLBANN_SB_BUILD_ALUMINUM=ON -DALUMINUM_ENABLE_NCCL=ON \
        -DLBANN_SB_FWD_ALUMINUM_NCCL_DIR=/usr/WS2/brain/nccl2/nccl_2.4.2-1+cuda10.0_x86_64 \
        -DLBANN_SB_BUILD_HYDROGEN=ON \
        -DLBANN_SB_BUILD_LBANN=ON \
        -DLBANN_SB_FWD_CUDNN_DIR=/usr/WS2/brain/cudnn/cudnn-7.4.2/cuda-10.0_x86_64 \
        <other options> \
        /path/to/lbann/superbuild
