LBANN: Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network Toolkit
============================================================

The Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network toolkit (LBANN) is an
open-source, HPC-centric, deep learning training framework that is
optimized to compose multiple levels of parallelism.

LBANN provides model-parallel acceleration through domain
decomposition to optimize for strong scaling of network training.  It
also allows for composition of model-parallelism with both data
parallelism and ensemble training methods for training large neural
networks with massive amounts of data.  LBANN is able to take advantage of
tightly-coupled accelerators, low-latency high-bandwidth networking,
and high-bandwidth parallel file systems.

LBANN supports state-of-the-art training algorithms such as
unsupervised, self-supervised, and adversarial (GAN) training methods
in addition to traditional supervised learning.  It also supports
recurrent neural networks via back propagation through time (BPTT)
training, transfer learning, and multi-model and ensemble training
methods.

Users are advised to view `the Doxygen API Documentation
<_static/doxygen/html/index.html>`_ for API information.
